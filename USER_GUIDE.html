        <h1>Northwoods Focus Student Dashboard</h1>
        <p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>Welcome to your new Student Dashboard! This tool is designed to help you verify student rosters, track academic progress in real-time, and identify students who may need extra support—all from a single, visual interface.</p>

    <p>This guide will walk you through everything from setting up your classes to analyzing individual student performance.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Getting Started: Importing Data</h2>
    <p>The dashboard relies on data you import. There are two types of imports: <strong>Rosters</strong> (Who is in the class) and <strong>Class Data</strong> (How they are doing).</p>

    <h3>Step A: The Roster Import</h3>
    <p>Before you can track progress, the system needs to know who belongs in your classroom.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Import</strong> button in the top header.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>"Import Roster"</strong>.</li>
        <li>Choose your roster file (Excel/CSV).</li>
        <li><strong>What happens next?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The system checks your file against the current dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Strict Mode</strong>: If a student is in your file, they are added. If a student is <em>not</em> in your file, they are removed from the dashboard. This ensures your dashboard exactly matches your official list.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step B: Importing Student Progress</h3>
    <p>Once your students are seated, you can import their work.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Import</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Select <strong>"Import Class Data"</strong>.</li>
        <li>You can select one file or a whole batch of files (e.g., all 85 files for Science).</li>
        <li><strong>The Import Summary</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>After processing, a summary window will appear.</li>
                <li><strong>Successes</strong>: Shows how many students were updated.</li>
                <li><strong>Issues</strong>: If a student's name in the file essentially matches someone on your roster (e.g., "Jon Smith" vs "Jonathan Smith"), the system might ask you to confirm.</li>
                <li><strong>Results</strong>: Your students' cards will update instantly with their latest grades.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Managing Your Classroom Layout</h2>
    <p>You can arrange the student cards to match your physical classroom seating.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Move a Student</strong>: Simply click and drag any student card to a new spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Move Between Subjects</strong>: Drag a student from the "Science" quadrant to "Math" to transfer them relative to your dashboard view.</li>
        <li><strong>Save Your Seating Chart</strong>:
            <ol>
                <li>Hover over the label of any room (e.g., "SCIENCE HR").</li>
                <li>A small menu will appear. Click <strong>"Save Layout"</strong>.</li>
                <li>If you ever mess up the cards, just click <strong>"Restore Layout"</strong> to snap them back to your saved arrangement.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Monitoring Class Progress</h2>

    <h3>Using the Class History View</h3>
    <p>To see a high-level overview of everyone's work:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>"Class History"</strong> button in the top header.</li>
        <li>This opens a detailed list view.</li>
        <li><strong>By Student</strong>: See a list of students and scan for missing assignments or low grades.</li>
        <li><strong>By Class</strong>: Group everyone by subject to see if a specific class is struggling overall.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter Issues</strong>: Toggle the <strong>"Show Issues Only"</strong> button to hide students who are on track, letting you focus solely on those who need help.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Filtering the Dashboard (Student List & Filters)</h3>
    <p>You can refine the main dashboard to find specific groups of students.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Filter Icon</strong> (funnel) in any room header.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort</strong>: Arrange students by Name, Grade, or Progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Window</strong>: Pick a Start and End date to see only work done this week/month.</li>
                <li><strong>Alerts</strong>: Show only students with "Low Progress" or "Missing Assignments".</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Live Preview</strong>: As you change settings, the list on the right updates instantly to show you exactly who matches your criteria.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Deep Dive: Student Progress Detail</h2>

    <h3>The Header</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Student Selector</strong>: Quickly switch to another student using the dropdown on the left.</li>
        <li><strong>Class Selector</strong>: The colored dropdown shows the current class. If a student is taking two science classes (e.g., Biology AND Physics), use this dropdown to switch between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Export</strong>: Click "Export" to save an image of this report to share with parents or admin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Semester Calendar</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This shows a 4-month view of activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Intensity</strong>: Days with more activity appear darker.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: Click any day to see a pop-up list of exactly what assignments were submitted on that date.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Left Axis (Bars)</strong>: The number of activities completed each week.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Axis (Lines)</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid Green Line</strong>: The student's Completion % (How close they are to finishing the course).</li>
                <li><strong>Dashed White Line</strong>: The student's Average Grade.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hover</strong>: Hover over any dot to see the exact numbers for that week.</li>
    </ul>
