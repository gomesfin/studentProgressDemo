# User Guide: Northwoods Focus Student Dashboard

Welcome to your new Student Dashboard! This tool is designed to help you verify student rosters, track academic progress in real-time, and identify students who may need extra support—all from a single, visual interface.

This guide will walk you through everything from setting up your classes to analyzing individual student performance.

## 1. Getting Started: Importing Data

The dashboard relies on data you import. There are two types of imports: **Rosters** (Who is in the class) and **Class Data** (How they are doing).

### Step A: The Roster Import

Before you can track progress, the system needs to know who belongs in your classroom.

1. Click the **Import** button in the top header.
2. Select **"Import Roster"**.
3. Choose your roster file (Excel/CSV).
4. **What happens next?**
    * The system checks your file against the current dashboard.
    * **Strict Mode**: If a student is in your file, they are added. If a student is *not* in your file, they are removed from the dashboard. This ensures your dashboard exactly matches your official list.

### Step B: Importing Student Progress

Once your students are seated, you can import their work.

1. Click the **Import** button.
2. Select **"Import Class Data"**.
3. You can select one file or a whole batch of files (e.g., all 85 files for Science).
4. **The Import Summary**:
    * After processing, a summary window will appear.
    * **Successes**: Shows how many students were updated.
    * **Issues**: If a student's name in the file essentially matches someone on your roster (e.g., "Jon Smith" vs "Jonathan Smith"), the system might ask you to confirm.
    * **Results**: Your students' cards will update instantly with their latest grades.

## 2. Managing Your Classroom Layout

You can arrange the student cards to match your physical classroom seating.

* **Move a Student**: Simply click and drag any student card to a new spot.
* **Move Between Subjects**: Drag a student from the "Science" quadrant to "Math" to transfer them relative to your dashboard view.
* **Save Your Seating Chart**:
    1. Hover over the label of any room (e.g., "SCIENCE HR").
    2. A small menu will appear. Click **"Save Layout"**.
    3. If you ever mess up the cards, just click **"Restore Layout"** to snap them back to your saved arrangement.

## 3. Monitoring Class Progress

### Using the Class History View

To see a high-level overview of everyone's work:

1. Click the **"Class History"** button in the top header.
2. This opens a detailed list view.
3. **By Student**: See a list of students and scan for missing assignments or low grades.
4. **By Class**: Group everyone by subject to see if a specific class is struggling overall.
5. **Filter Issues**: Toggle the **"Show Issues Only"** button to hide students who are on track, letting you focus solely on those who need help.

### Filtering the Dashboard (Student List & Filters)

You can refine the main dashboard to find specific groups of students.

1. Click the **Filter Icon** (funnel) in any room header.
2. **Sort**: Arrange students by Name, Grade, or Progress.
3. **Filter**:
    * **Time Window**: Pick a Start and End date to see only work done this week/month.
    * **Alerts**: Show only students with "Low Progress" or "Missing Assignments".
4. **Live Preview**: As you change settings, the list on the right updates instantly to show you exactly who matches your criteria.

## 4. Deep Dive: Student Progress Detail

Click on any Student Card to open their **Progress Detail View**. This is your command center for an individual student.

### The Header

* **Student Selector**: Quickly switch to another student using the dropdown on the left.
* **Class Selector**: The colored dropdown shows the current class. If a student is taking two science classes (e.g., Biology AND Physics), use this dropdown to switch between them.
* **Export**: Click "Export" to save an image of this report to share with parents or admin.

### The Semester Calendar

* This shows a 4-month view of activity.
* **Color Intensity**: Days with more activity appear darker.
* **Interactive**: Click any day to see a pop-up list of exactly what assignments were submitted on that date.

### The Performance Graph

* **Left Axis (Bars)**: The number of activities completed each week.
* **Right Axis (Lines)**:
  * **Solid Green Line**: The student's Completion % (How close they are to finishing the course).
  * **Dashed White Line**: The student's Average Grade.
* **Hover**: Hover over any dot to see the exact numbers for that week.

With these tools, you can move from a "Big Picture" view of your entire roster down to the specific assignment details of a single student in seconds.
